# Narrow GitHub

Style rules to make GitHub play nicer with narrower viewports.

GitHub works okay on larger screens but I've found that when I want to make a GitHub window narrower, things get pushed off the edge.

(Sidenote: if you want GitHub to be fluid on larger screens, check out [github-wide](https://github.com/mdo/github-wide). This repo was very much inspired by github-wide.)

## Usage
Copy the contents of github-narrow.css into your browser's user style manager. Make sure you restrict the domain it is to be applied to `github.com`.

If you don't have one, here is one example called Stylish
